During my years as a System Administrator, I had the invaluable opportunity to work with a diverse client base, providing IT consultancy, support, and tailored solutions to meet their specific needs. This role allowed me to deepen my understanding and application of essential system administration and network management concepts. My responsibilities and achievements in this role included:

Server Management and Virtualization: I was responsible for the installation, configuration, and management of physical servers using VMware, enabling efficient virtualization for our clients. Alongside this, I ensured data security and integrity with Veeam backup systems, facilitating reliable disaster recovery and data protection strategies.

Network Security and Firewall Configuration: To safeguard network infrastructures, I handled the installation and configuration of firewall systems. I applied best practices in cybersecurity to protect sensitive data, enabling robust defenses against network vulnerabilities and unauthorized access.

User and Identity Management: My role included managing user identities and access permissions through Windows Active Directory, ensuring secure and organized access to resources. Additionally, I handled Office 365 administration, configuring services and user accounts to meet productivity and communication needs across organizations.

Unified Communication Systems: I set up and maintained 3CX telephone switchboards, enabling smooth and efficient communication for clients. This work included everything from initial configuration to troubleshooting, ensuring seamless connectivity across all channels.

Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM): Using ConnectWise, I managed remote systems effectively, proactively monitoring for potential issues, and performing necessary maintenance tasks. This software was integral to maintaining system health and minimizing downtime for client systems.

Programming for Custom Solutions: For specific internal requirements, I developed custom programs using .NET and C#. These applications addressed various business needs, automating tasks, enhancing efficiency, and providing tailored solutions for internal clients.

My role as a System Administrator was more than just technicalâ€”it was about problem-solving, collaboration, and understanding client needs to deliver effective and secure IT environments. Each technology and tool I employed contributed to creating reliable, efficient, and secure systems that met a wide array of client requirements.
