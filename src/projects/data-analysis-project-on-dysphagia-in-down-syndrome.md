This project focused on the data analysis and visualization components supporting a specialized thesis in medicine and forthcoming scientific publication on dysphagia in individuals with Down syndrome. My objectives were to preprocess, analyze, and visualize key data to substantiate clinical insights effectively.

## Methodology and Data Processing

###### 
Data was carefully cleaned, organized, and subjected to preprocessing steps to ensure reliability and quality. This involved:

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and standardizing data formats.
Data Transformation: Applying necessary statistical transformations to align with analysis goals.



The project placed particular emphasis on clear, informative visualizations to support clinical interpretations. The final result of my analysis wera Boxplots, Likert plots, Bar plots and Radar Plots useful for interpretations of the data.
