In this **work** project, i've developed a desktop application for a multinational appliance manufacturer, enabling key users to analyze monthly sales and order data. Built using VB.Net and DevExpress for visualizations, the solution connects to an SQL database where data is uploaded from CSV and Excel files, streamlining the reporting process.

The workflow automated data upload, parsing files by type, and formatting them for SQL storage. Key visualizations included cumulative bar charts representing daily sales and shipments, with filters for brand, product line, and more. This solution also provided Excel exports and specific analytic views, enabling users to assess sales margins and projections.

Further work could include sales forecasting and stock predictions based on historical data.
